    This version utilizes Jaro-Winkler distance, which is a metric of
    edit distance. Jaro-Winkler specially prioritizes the early
    characters in a string.

    Since the ends of strings are often more valuable in matching names
    and addresses, we reverse the strings before matching them.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance
    https://github.com/Yomguithereal/talisman/blob/master/src/metrics/jaro-winkler.js

    The exact meaning of the metric is open, but the following must hold true:
    1. equivalent strings must return 1
    2. strings with no similar characters must return 0
    3. strings with higher intuitive similarity must return higher scores

    Args:
        string1: any string
        string2: any string
    Returns:

    Sample Usage:

    0.0
